- `N8N_HOST`, `N8N_PORT`, `N8N_PROTOCOL` (Core settings)
- `WEBHOOK_URL`, `GENERIC_TIMEZONE`
- `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (Security)
- `DB_*` (Database connection)

## üåê Access Methods

After deployment, access n8n using any of these methods. The SSL certificate includes all network IP addresses for seamless access:

### 1. Local Access (On the Server)
```
https://localhost
https://127.0.0.1
```

### 2. SSH Tunnel (Recommended for Remote Access)
```bash
ssh -L 8443:localhost:443 username@server-ip
```
Then visit: `https://localhost:8443`

### 3. Internal Network Access (All Network Interfaces)
```
https://YOUR_SERVER_IP
```
Examples: 
- `https://192.168.1.200` (LAN IP)
- `https://10.0.1.100` (VPN or secondary network)
- All detected network interfaces are included in the certificate

### Port Requirements by Setup Type

**üîê Default Setup (Local/Internal Access Only):**
- Port 443: Exposed to internal network only
- Recommended access: SSH tunnel or VPN

**üåê With Cloudflare Proxy (Internet-Facing):**
- Port 443: Can remain CLOSED on firewall (Cloudflare routes traffic)
- DNS-01 certificates: No ports required for SSL certificate generation
- Ideal for: Dynamic IPs, home servers, enhanced security

**üì° Direct Internet Access (Not Recommended):**
- Port 443: Must be open for direct access
- Higher security risk without proxy protection
- Consider Cloudflare proxy for better security

**Authentication**:
n8n uses email/password authentication. You'll create your credentials during the initial n8n setup when you first access the interface.

- Removes installation directory
- Preserves Docker volumes for future use

### Option 2: Uninstall - No backup
```bash
./n8n-master.sh ‚Üí 3) Uninstall n8n ‚Üí 2) Uninstall - No backup
# Type 'yes' to confirm complete deletion
```

This removes:
- All Docker containers and volumes
- Installation directory
- Systemd service and cron jobs
- All data (workflows, database, backups)

### Fresh Installation with Backup Restore (Recommended)

**Best Method for New VMs or Systems:**
1. **Download script** on fresh system: `wget https://your-script-url/n8n-master.sh && chmod +x n8n-master.sh`
2. **Copy backup file** to new system (e.g., `scp backup.tar.gz user@newserver:~/`)
3. **Run deployment**: `./n8n-master.sh`
4. **Select "Deploy n8n"**
5. **Choose backup to restore** (shows timestamp and size)

**What Happens During Installation Restore:**
- ‚úÖ **Complete dependency installation**: Docker, UFW, fail2ban, certbot, system tools
- ‚úÖ **Full system configuration**: All security components installed and configured  
- ‚úÖ **Data restoration**: Database, workflows, configurations, certificates
- ‚úÖ **Security restoration**: DNS credentials, firewall rules, fail2ban config
- ‚úÖ **Automatic adaptation**: Certificates and configs adapted to new environment

### Alternative: Menu-Based Restore (Post-Installation)
After n8n is already installed:
1. Run `./n8n-master.sh ‚Üí 1) Manage n8n ‚Üí 6) Restore Backup`
2. **Limitation**: Assumes dependencies already installed (doesn't install missing security tools)

#### Cross-System Migration & VM Rebuild
The backup system now supports **complete cross-system migration** with automatic adaptation to different environments:

**Migration Process:**
1. **Copy backup** to new system (different hostname/IP/VM)
2. **Run installation** with backup selection
3. **Automatic adaptation** handles environment differences

**What Gets Automatically Adapted:**
- ‚úÖ **SSL Certificates**: Self-signed certificates regenerated with new IP addresses
- ‚úÖ **Domain Certificates**: Let's Encrypt certificates work unchanged (domain-based)
- ‚úÖ **Firewall Rules**: UFW configuration restored with compatibility checks
- ‚úÖ **Security Services**: fail2ban and all configurations restored seamlessly
- ‚úÖ **DNS Credentials**: All provider credentials restored for certificate renewal

**Migration Scenarios Supported:**
- Same datacenter, different server
- Different cloud provider (AWS ‚Üí GCP ‚Üí DigitalOcean)
- Different IP ranges/subnets
- Different hostnames
- Different Linux distributions (Ubuntu/Debian variants)

## üè† Dynamic IP & Home Server Setup

Perfect for home servers, Synology NAS, and dynamic IP environments with enhanced security:

### Benefits of Dynamic IP Support

**üîÑ CNAME + Cloudflare Proxy Setup:**
- ‚úÖ **Automatic IP Updates**: CNAME follows your dynamic DNS service (synology.me, duckdns.org)
- ‚úÖ **DDoS Protection**: Cloudflare proxy shields your real IP address
- ‚úÖ **Closed Firewall Ports**: No need to open port 443 on your router/firewall
- ‚úÖ **SSL Certificates**: DNS-01 challenge works behind closed ports
- ‚úÖ **No Manual Updates**: Dynamic IP changes handled automatically

### Example: Synology DDoS Setup

**Before n8n-master.sh:**
```
Router: Port 443 open ‚Üí Your Dynamic IP ‚Üí Synology NAS ‚Üí n8n
DNS: CNAME n8n.example.com ‚Üí whycanti.synology.me
Issues: ‚ùå Exposed IP, ‚ùå No DDoS protection, ‚ùå Direct attacks possible
```

**After n8n-master.sh with Cloudflare:**
```
Internet ‚Üí Cloudflare (DDoS protection) ‚Üí Your Dynamic IP ‚Üí n8n
Router: Port 443 can be CLOSED (recommended)
DNS: CNAME n8n.example.com ‚Üí whycanti.synology.me (proxy enabled)
Benefits: ‚úÖ Hidden IP, ‚úÖ DDoS protection, ‚úÖ Closed ports, ‚úÖ Auto-updates
```

### Setup Process for Dynamic IPs

1. **Configure Your Dynamic DNS** (if not already done):
   - Set up synology.me, duckdns.org, or no-ip.com
   - Ensure your router/NAS updates the record automatically

2. **Deploy n8n**:
   ```bash
   ./n8n-master.sh
   # Select: Deploy n8n
   ```

3. **Configure Cloudflare Protection**:
   ```bash
   ./n8n-master.sh ‚Üí Security & SSL Settings ‚Üí Configure Cloudflare Protection
   ```
   - Script detects your existing CNAME setup
   - Recommends keeping CNAME + enabling proxy
   - Select option 1: "Keep CNAME and enable Cloudflare proxy"

4. **Optional: Close Firewall Port**:
   - Your n8n is now protected by Cloudflare
   - You can safely close port 443 on your router/firewall
   - Traffic routes through Cloudflare's global network

### Supported Dynamic DNS Providers

**Automatically Detected:**
- ‚úÖ **Synology DDoS**: yourname.synology.me
- ‚úÖ **Duck DNS**: yourname.duckdns.org  
- ‚úÖ **No-IP**: yourname.no-ip.com
- ‚úÖ **Custom Services**: Any CNAME pointing to dynamic hostnames

**Script Behavior:**
- Preserves existing CNAME configurations
- Shows clear benefits of your current setup
- Recommends optimal security enhancements
- Never forces changes to working configurations
