## 🌐 Access Methods

After deployment, access n8n using any of these methods. The SSL certificate includes all network IP addresses for seamless access:

### 1. Local Access (On the Server)
```
https://localhost
https://127.0.0.1
```

### 2. SSH Tunnel (Recommended for Remote Access)
```bash
ssh -L 8443:localhost:443 username@server-ip
```
Then visit: `https://localhost:8443`

### 3. Internal Network Access (All Network Interfaces)
```
https://YOUR_SERVER_IP
```
Examples: 
- `https://192.168.1.200` (LAN IP)
- `https://10.0.1.100` (VPN or secondary network)
- All detected network interfaces are included in the certificate

**Note**: Port 443 is only exposed internally. For internet access, use SSH tunneling or configure additional security measures.

**Authentication**:
n8n uses email/password authentication. You'll create your credentials during the initial n8n setup when you first access the interface.
