ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-..."
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY = "pplx-..."
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL = "https://hooks.slack.com/..."
```

### Access in n8n Workflows
Use the Expression syntax:
- `{{ $env.OPENAI_API_KEY }}`
- `{{ $env.PERPLEXITY_API_KEY }}`
- `{{ $env.MY_CUSTOM_VAR }}`

### Protected System Variables
The following variables cannot be removed (protection built-in):
- `POSTGRES_*` (Database configuration)
- `N8N_BASIC_AUTH_*` (Authentication)
- `N8N_HOST`, `N8N_PORT`, `N8N_PROTOCOL` (Core settings)
- `WEBHOOK_URL`, `GENERIC_TIMEZONE`
- `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (Security)
- `DB_*` (Database connection)

## üåê Access Methods

After deployment, access n8n using any of these methods. The SSL certificate includes all network IP addresses for seamless access:

### 1. Local Access (On the Server)
```
https://localhost
https://127.0.0.1
```

### 2. SSH Tunnel (Recommended for Remote Access)
```bash
ssh -L 8443:localhost:443 username@server-ip
```
Then visit: `https://localhost:8443`

### 3. Internal Network Access (All Network Interfaces)
```
https://YOUR_SERVER_IP
```
Examples: 
- `https://192.168.1.200` (LAN IP)
- `https://10.0.1.100` (VPN or secondary network)
- All detected network interfaces are included in the certificate

**Note**: Port 443 is only exposed internally. For internet access, use SSH tunneling or configure additional security measures.

**Authentication**:
n8n uses email/password authentication. You'll create your credentials during the initial n8n setup when you first access the interface.
