3. **Update variable** - Modify existing variable value
4. **Remove variable** - Remove variable (system variables protected)

### Automatic Service Recreation
After adding, updating, or removing variables, the script now prompts:
```
Recreate services now to apply changes? (y/n):
```
- **'y'**: Automatically recreates services to apply changes immediately
- **'n'**: Shows reminder to recreate services manually later

### Add API Keys Example
```bash
# Through interactive menu:
./n8n-master.sh ‚Üí 1) Manage n8n ‚Üí 11) Manage Environment Variables ‚Üí 2) Add new variable

# Example variables to add:
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-..."
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-..."
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY = "pplx-..."
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL = "https://hooks.slack.com/..."
```

### Access in n8n Workflows
Use the Expression syntax:
- `{{ $env.OPENAI_API_KEY }}`
- `{{ $env.PERPLEXITY_API_KEY }}`
- `{{ $env.MY_CUSTOM_VAR }}`

### Protected System Variables
The following variables cannot be removed (protection built-in):
- `POSTGRES_*` (Database configuration)
- `N8N_BASIC_AUTH_*` (Authentication)
- `N8N_HOST`, `N8N_PORT`, `N8N_PROTOCOL` (Core settings)
- `N8N_SSL_KEY`, `N8N_SSL_CERT` (End-to-end HTTPS encryption)
- `WEBHOOK_URL`, `GENERIC_TIMEZONE`
- `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (Security)
- `DB_*` (Database connection)

## üåê Access Methods

After deployment, access n8n using any of these methods. The SSL certificate includes all network IP addresses for seamless access:

### 1. Local Access (On the Server)
```
https://localhost
https://127.0.0.1
```

### 2. SSH Tunnel (Recommended for Remote Access)
```bash
ssh -L 8443:localhost:443 username@server-ip
```
Then visit: `https://localhost:8443`

### 3. Internal Network Access (All Network Interfaces)
```
https://YOUR_SERVER_IP
```
Examples: 
- `https://192.168.1.200` (LAN IP)
- `https://10.0.1.100` (VPN or secondary network)
- All detected network interfaces are included in the certificate

### Port Requirements by Setup Type

**üîê Default Setup (Local/Internal Access Only):**
- Port 443: Exposed to internal network only
- Recommended access: SSH tunnel or VPN

**üåê With Cloudflare Proxy (Internet-Facing):**
- Port 443: Must be open for Cloudflare to connect OR restricted to Cloudflare IPs only
- DNS-01 certificates: No ports required for SSL certificate generation
- Ideal for: Dynamic IPs, home servers, enhanced security
- **NEW**: Use Cloudflare IP Whitelist feature for secure restricted access

**üì° Direct Internet Access (Not Recommended):**
- Port 443: Must be open for direct access
- Higher security risk without proxy protection
- Consider Cloudflare proxy for better security

**Authentication**:
n8n uses email/password authentication. You'll create your credentials during the initial n8n setup when you first access the interface.

### Option 2: Uninstall - No backup
```bash
./n8n-master.sh ‚Üí 3) Uninstall n8n ‚Üí 2) Uninstall - No backup
# Type 'yes' to confirm complete deletion
```

This removes:
- All Docker containers and volumes
- Installation directory
- Systemd service and cron jobs
- All data (workflows, database, backups)

### Fresh Installation with Backup Restore (Recommended)

**Best Method for New VMs or Systems:**
1. **Download script** on fresh system: `wget https://your-script-url/n8n-master.sh && chmod +x n8n-master.sh`
2. **Copy backup file** to new system (e.g., `scp backup.tar.gz user@newserver:~/`)
3. **Run deployment**: `./n8n-master.sh`
4. **Select "Deploy n8n"**
5. **Choose backup to restore** (shows timestamp and size)

**What Happens During Installation Restore:**
- ‚úÖ **Complete dependency installation**: Docker, UFW, fail2ban, certbot, system tools
- ‚úÖ **Full system configuration**: All security components installed and configured  
- ‚úÖ **Data restoration**: Database, workflows, configurations, certificates
- ‚úÖ **Security restoration**: DNS credentials, firewall rules, fail2ban config
- ‚úÖ **Enterprise SSL validation**: Certificate validation and health endpoint testing
- ‚úÖ **Security feature verification**: Ensures all enterprise security components work correctly
- ‚úÖ **Automatic adaptation**: Certificates and configs adapted to new environment

### Alternative: Menu-Based Restore (Post-Installation)
After n8n is already installed:
1. Run `./n8n-master.sh ‚Üí 1) Manage n8n ‚Üí 6) Restore Backup`
2. **Limitation**: Assumes dependencies already installed (doesn't install missing security tools)

#### Cross-System Migration & VM Rebuild
The backup system now supports **complete cross-system migration** with automatic adaptation to different environments:

**Migration Process:**
1. **Copy backup** to new system (different hostname/IP/VM)
2. **Run installation** with backup selection
3. **Automatic adaptation** handles environment differences

**What Gets Automatically Adapted:**
- ‚úÖ **SSL Certificates**: Self-signed certificates regenerated with new IP addresses
- ‚úÖ **Domain Certificates**: Let's Encrypt certificates work unchanged (domain-based)
- ‚úÖ **Firewall Rules**: UFW configuration restored with compatibility checks

./n8n-master.sh ‚Üí 1) Manage n8n ‚Üí 1) View Status

# Check logs for errors  
./n8n-master.sh ‚Üí 1) Manage n8n ‚Üí 2) View Logs

# Try recreating services
./n8n-master.sh ‚Üí 1) Manage n8n ‚Üí 4) Recreate Services
```

### Cloudflare Proxy Connection Timeout

If you get connection timeouts after enabling Cloudflare proxy:

```bash
# Option 1: Enable Cloudflare IP Whitelist (Recommended)
./n8n-master.sh ‚Üí Security & SSL Settings ‚Üí Cloudflare IP Whitelist Management ‚Üí Enable

# Option 2: Open port 443 to all (Less Secure)
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw reload

# Option 3: Manual Cloudflare IP whitelist
curl https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v4 -o /tmp/cf-ips.txt
while read ip; do sudo ufw allow from $ip to any port 443; done < /tmp/cf-ips.txt
```

**Verification Commands:**
```bash
# Check if domain resolves to Cloudflare IPs
dig +short your.domain.com

# Verify proxy is enabled (should show Cloudflare IPs, not your server IP)
# Should return IPs like 104.21.x.x or 172.67.x.x

# Check local connectivity
curl -k https://localhost  # Should work from server

# Check UFW rules
sudo ufw status numbered | grep 443
```

### Locked Out by fail2ban
```bash
# If you're accidentally banned by fail2ban:

# Option 1: Unban your specific IP
./n8n-master.sh ‚Üí Manage n8n ‚Üí Security & SSL Settings ‚Üí View fail2ban Status ‚Üí Manage Banned IPs ‚Üí Unban Specific IP

# Option 2: Add your IP to permanent whitelist  
./n8n-master.sh ‚Üí Manage n8n ‚Üí Security & SSL Settings ‚Üí View fail2ban Status ‚Üí Manage Banned IPs ‚Üí Add IP to Whitelist

# Option 3: Emergency clear all bans (if you can't access via SSH)
# From another system or console: sudo fail2ban-client unban --all
```

### Docker Permission Issues
If you see "permission denied" errors:
```bash
# Ensure user is in docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and back in, then try again
```

### SSL Certificate Issues
```bash
# Check certificate validity
openssl x509 -in ~/n8n/certs/n8n.crt -noout -dates

# Manually renew certificate
./n8n-master.sh ‚Üí 1) Manage n8n ‚Üí 10) Renew SSL Certificate
```

### Migration & Cross-System Issues
Problems after restoring backup to different system:

#### SSL Certificate Not Working on New IP/Hostname
```bash
# Check if certificate matches current system
openssl x509 -in ~/n8n/certs/n8n.crt -text -noout | grep -A5 "Subject Alternative Name"

# Compare with current system IPs
hostname -I

# If IPs don't match, regenerate certificate:
rm ~/n8n/certs/n8n.crt ~/n8n/certs/n8n.key
./n8n-master.sh ‚Üí 1) Manage n8n ‚Üí 4) Recreate Services
```

#### Firewall Rules Not Working
```bash
# Check UFW status after restoration
sudo ufw status verbose

# If UFW failed to enable during restoration:
sudo ufw --force enable

# If rules are missing, reconfigure manually:
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp comment 'SSH'
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp comment 'n8n HTTPS'
sudo ufw --force enable
```

#### fail2ban Not Starting
```bash
# Check fail2ban status
sudo systemctl status fail2ban

# If fail2ban config is incompatible:
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban

# Verify n8n jail is active:
sudo fail2ban-client status n8n-auth
```

#### DNS Provider Credentials Missing
```bash
# Check if credentials were restored
ls -la ~/n8n/.*.ini ~/n8n/.google-cloud.json ~/.aws/credentials 2>/dev/null

# If missing, reconfigure Let's Encrypt:
./n8n-master.sh ‚Üí 1) Manage n8n ‚Üí Security & SSL Settings ‚Üí Configure Let's Encrypt
```

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Test database connectivity through health check
./n8n-master.sh ‚Üí 1) Manage n8n ‚Üí 8) Health Check

# View PostgreSQL logs
./n8n-master.sh ‚Üí 1) Manage n8n ‚Üí 2) View Logs ‚Üí 2) PostgreSQL
```

### Security Audit Accuracy (Enhanced in v2.2.0)
The security audit now provides accurate validation with fixed pattern matching:
```bash
# Previously might show false warnings, now shows accurate status:
‚úÖ Internal network access configured (5 general rules)
‚úÖ All Cloudflare IP ranges properly configured (22/22 rules) 
‚úÖ Local management access is preserved (general rules)
üõ°Ô∏è Excellent security posture!
```

**Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ **UFW Pattern Matching**: Correctly detects internal network rules
- ‚úÖ **IPv6 Rule Counting**: Accurate counting of both IPv4 and IPv6 Cloudflare rules
- ‚úÖ **False Warning Elimination**: No more "you may be locked out" false alarms
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Validation**: All security components properly verified

## üîí Security Notes

1. **Self-Signed Certificate**: Browser warnings are normal. Certificates include all network IP addresses for seamless access. Add exception to proceed.
2. **Local Network Only**: No external ports exposed by default
3. **Sensitive Data**: 
   - `.env` file has 600 permissions
   - Passwords are auto-generated and secure
   - Backups contain sensitive data - store securely
   - Sensitive environment variables are masked in display

## üìù Common Use Cases

### API Integration Setup
```bash
# Add API keys through interactive menu
./n8n-master.sh ‚Üí 1) Manage n8n ‚Üí 11) Manage Environment Variables ‚Üí 2) Add new variable

# Example variables:
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-..."
SLACK_TOKEN = "xoxb-..."
GITHUB_TOKEN = "ghp_..."

# Select 'y' when prompted to recreate services
```

### Production Environment

## üè† Dynamic IP & Home Server Setup

Perfect for home servers, Synology NAS, and dynamic IP environments with enhanced security:

### Benefits of Dynamic IP Support

**üîÑ CNAME + Cloudflare Proxy Setup:**
- ‚úÖ **Automatic IP Updates**: CNAME follows your dynamic DNS service (synology.me, duckdns.org)
- ‚úÖ **DDoS Protection**: Cloudflare proxy shields your real IP address
- ‚úÖ **Closed Firewall Ports**: No need to open port 443 on your router/firewall
- ‚úÖ **SSL Certificates**: DNS-01 challenge works behind closed ports
- ‚úÖ **No Manual Updates**: Dynamic IP changes handled automatically

### Example: Synology DDoS Setup

**Before n8n-master.sh:**
```
Router: Port 443 open ‚Üí Your Dynamic IP ‚Üí Synology NAS ‚Üí n8n
DNS: CNAME n8n.example.com ‚Üí whycanti.synology.me
Issues: ‚ùå Exposed IP, ‚ùå No DDoS protection, ‚ùå Direct attacks possible
```

**After n8n-master.sh with Cloudflare:**
```
Internet ‚Üí Cloudflare (DDoS protection) ‚Üí Your Dynamic IP ‚Üí n8n
Router: Port 443 can be CLOSED (recommended)
DNS: CNAME n8n.example.com ‚Üí whycanti.synology.me (proxy enabled)
Benefits: ‚úÖ Hidden IP, ‚úÖ DDoS protection, ‚úÖ Closed ports, ‚úÖ Auto-updates
```

### Setup Process for Dynamic IPs

1. **Configure Your Dynamic DNS** (if not already done):
   - Set up synology.me, duckdns.org, or no-ip.com
   - Ensure your router/NAS updates the record automatically

2. **Deploy n8n**:
   ```bash
   ./n8n-master.sh
   # Select: Deploy n8n
   ```

3. **Configure Cloudflare Protection**:
